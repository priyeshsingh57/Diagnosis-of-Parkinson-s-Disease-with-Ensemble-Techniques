Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disorder marked by decreased dopamine levels in the brain.

There is commonly a marked effect on speech, including dysarthria (difficulty articulating sounds), 
hypophonia (lowered volumcur, and risk of dementia is increased.  

Traditional diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease involves a clinician taking a neurological history of the patient and 
observing motor skills in various situations. Since there is no definitive laboratory test to diagnose PD, 
diagnosis is often difficult, particularly in the early stages when motor effects are not yet severe. 
Monitoring progression of the disease over time requires repeated clinic visits by the patient. 
An effective screening process, particularly one that doesn’t require a clinic visit, would be beneficial. 
Since PD patients exhibit characteristic vocal features, voice recordings are a useful and non-invasive tool for diagnosis. 
If machine learning algorithms could be applied to a voice recording dataset to accurately diagnosis PD, 
this would be an effective screening step prior to an appointment with a clinician.
